        "\n",
        "Interpreters run through a program line by line and execute each command. Here, if the author decides he wants to use a different kind of olive oil, he could scratch the old one out and add the new one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute. As a result, they tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than interpreted languages. They also give the developer more control over hardware aspects, like memory management and CPU usage.\n",

        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows a program to continue running or exit gracefully when an unexpected error occurs.  It allows you to catch exceptions that occur during the execution of a block of code by using a try block to wrap the code that might raise an exception, and an except block to catch and handle the exception.\n",

        "\n",
        "__del__ is a finalizer. It is called when an object is garbage collected which happens at some point after all references to the object have been deleted. In a simple case this could be right after you say del x or, if x is a local variable, after the function ends.The __del__ method in Python is a powerful tool for managing resource cleanup when objects are destroyed.\n",

        "\n",
        "Python allows you to catch multiple exceptions in a single 'except' block by specifying them as a tuple. This feature is useful when different exceptions require similar handling logic. In this case, if either 'ExceptionType1' or 'ExceptionType2' is raised, the code within the 'except' block will be executed.\n",

        "\n",
        "In Python, with statement is used in exception handling to make the code cleaner and much more readable. It simplifies the management of common resources like file streams. Observe the following code example on how the use of with statement makes code cleaner. The with statement itself ensures proper acquisition and release of resources. An exception during the file.write() call in the first implementation can prevent the file from closing properly which may introduce several bugs in the code,i.e. many changes in files do not go into effect until the file is properly closed.\n",

        "Use the finally block\n",
        "This block can be used to execute code that needs to be run regardless of whether an exception occurs. For example, you can use the finally block to close file resources, close database connections, or display a message at the end of the program.\n",

        "13.  Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Python memory management helps the user to deal with various technologies like development or data analysis. Python memory management refers to the way in which a programming language handles the allocation and deallocation of memory resources. While moving further with this article we will discuss how is memory managed in python, garbage collector, and how to change it, followed by its applications and methods to deallocate memory. Python Memory Management is based on a technique known as reference counting. In this approach, every object in Python has a reference count associated with it. The reference count is the number of variables and other objects that refer to a particular object. When the reference count for an object becomes zero, the object is deleted from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, errors and exceptions can interrupt the execution of program. Python provides try and except blocks to handle situations like this. In case an error occurs in try-block, Python stops executing try block adn jumps to exception block. These blocks let you handle the errors without crashing the program. A Try-Except statement is a code block that allows your program to take alternative actions in case an error occurs. Python will first attempt to execute the code in the try statement (code block 1). If no exception occurs, the except statement is skipped and the execution of the try statement is finished.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Garbage collection is a memory management technique used in programming languages to automatically reclaim memory that is no longer accessible or in use by the application. It helps prevent memory leaks, optimize memory usage, and ensure efficient memory allocation for the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "The else keyword is used in conditional statements (if statements), and decides what to do if the condition is False. The ELSE statement specifies that alternate processing is to take place when the conditions of the matching IF statement are not satisfied. The ELSE statement has no parameters. The ELSE statement must be column-aligned with the matching IF statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "There are various common types of logging levels, including WARN, ERROR, INFO, DEBUG FATAL and TRACE. Each one serves its unique purpose and should be considered before proceeding with its usage.\n",

        "DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n",
        "INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n",
        "WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g., ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.\n",

        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The only real difference between the os.fork and multiprocessing.Process is portability and library overhead, since os.fork is not supported in windows, and the multiprocessing framework is included to make multiprocessing.Process work. This is because os.fork is called by multiprocessing.Process, as this answer backs up.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Python does not flush the buffer that is writing data to the file until it is certain you are finished writing, which can be accomplished by closing the file. If you write to a file without closing it, the data will not be saved to the destination file. files are limited resources managed by the operating system, making sure files are closed after use will protect against hard-to-debug issues like running out of file handles or experiencing corrupted data.\n",
        "\n",
        " 20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Read method reads the whole file as a single string while readlines segregates each of the line in the file and you then can later on call them line by line.In Python, the `read()` method is used to read a specified number of characters from a file or input stream, while the `readline()` method is used to read a single line from a file or input stream. The `read()` method will read the entire content of the file or stream if no argument is provided, returning a string.\n",

        "\n",
        "Python has a built-in os module with methods for interacting with the operating system, like creating files and directories, management of files and directories, input, output, environment variables, process management, etc.\n",
        "The os module can be used to perform different operations on file systems using python. Unlike built-in functions, the os module reads and writes data to the file system in the form of bytes. The methods like open() , write(), read() and close() are also defined in the os module with different specifications and properties compared to in built functions. To use the methods, we can import the os module as follows.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic problem in managing memory is knowing when to keep the data it contains, and when to throw it away so that the memory can be reused. This sounds easy, but is, in fact, such a hard problem that it is an entire field of study in its own right. The inefficiency in this memory optimization technique is higher and the memory might come as surplus. Moreover, it results in the inefficient use of resources.It has limited dynamic adaptability which means it is not adapted well to the changing memory requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "To raise a custom exception, use the raise keyword followed by an instance of your custom exception. Here the divide method raises the 'MyCustomError' when an attempt to divide by zero is made.The raise statement allows you to force an error to occur. You can define both the type of error and the text that prints to the user. Note that the argument to raise must either be an exception instance or a subclass deriving from exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "Multithreading minimizes the time required for context switching compared to switching between separate processes, as threads within the same process share the same memory space and can switch more quickly. This results in reduced overhead and improved system responsiveness.A web server will utilize multiple threads to simultaneous process requests for data at the same time.\n",
